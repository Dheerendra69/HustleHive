## Implementation Notes

### auth.ts
**Issue:** 1. Introduced AuthOptions with explicit `secret` and `jwt.secret` sourced from environment variables to prevent default weak secrets. 2. Configured session strategy to JWT with `maxAge` to limit session lifetime. 3. Added callbacks to propagate `user.id` and `user.role` into the session and JWT, enabling robust role-based access. 4. Provided credential provider stub with an `authorize` function as a placeholder for secure password checks (e.g., bcrypt). 5. Enforced domain-based sign-in rule in `signIn` callback to prevent unauthorized accounts.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Always store `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_JWT_SECRET` in a secure vault or environment.  
â€¢ Use HTTPS in production to protect cookies and tokens in transit.  
â€¢ Rotate secrets periodically and invalidate old sessions.  
â€¢ Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication if possible.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import { AuthOptions } from 'next-auth'
- import GitHubProvider from 'next-auth/providers/github'
- import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials'

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt sign-in with invalid credentials and verify access is denied.
- Verify session JWT contains `role` and `sub` claims.
- Test session expiration after `maxAge`.
- Ensure CSRF protection is active by inspecting cookies.

### sanity/lib/write-client.ts
**Issue:** 1. Retrieves `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` directly from `process.env` and immediately throws an error if missing, preventing misconfiguration. 2. Sets `useCdn: false` to ensure writes go to the authoritative API and not the read-optimized CDN. 3. Enables `ignoreBrowserTokenWarning` to reduce the risk of accidentally bundling the write token into client code.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Keep `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` only in server-side environment files (e.g., `.env.local`) and never expose it to the browser.  
â€¢ Rotate the token periodically and scope its permissions to only necessary write operations.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Remove or rename `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` and confirm server errors.
- Perform a write operation to verify client works.
- Inspect bundler output to ensure token is not leaked.

### lib/actions.ts
**Issue:** 1. Imported `zod` to strictly validate and sanitize every incoming field, preventing injection vectors. 2. Used `getServerSession` with `authOptions` to guarantee requests are authenticated server-side. 3. Applied a role-based check so that only the owner or an admin may create the post. 4. Leveraged Sanity's `create` method with explicit object fields, avoiding any string interpolation or raw queries.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Extend the schema if additional fields are needed, always validating max lengths.  
â€¢ Log authorization failures without exposing internal data.  
â€¢ Consider rate-limiting endpoints to mitigate brute-force or spam.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import { z } from 'zod'
- import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
- import { authOptions } from '../auth'
- import { writeClient } from '../sanity/lib/write-client'

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid and invalid payloads to verify schema enforcement.
- Attempt to create a post under a different user id to confirm 403 responses.
- Check that no raw data or errors leak stack traces.

### sanity/env.ts
**Issue:** 1. Removed any reference to `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` so that it cannot be accidentally bundled into client code. 2. Validates presence of `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `SANITY_DATASET`, throwing early if missing. 3. Exports only public-facing configuration values.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Keep `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` in server-only modules (e.g., `write-client.ts`) and never in this shared env file.  
â€¢ Use `.env.local` and never commit secrets to version control.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Build a production bundle and verify `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` is absent.
- Access client code to ensure no token string appears.
- Run local dev server with missing vars to check thrown errors.
